# Queen at Twenty-One: A Collection of Love Poems

## 1. A Stranger's Smile
A stranger first, a name on a screen,  
Unknown worlds behind eyes unseen,  
A "hello" typed, so simple, so small,  
Yet in that moment, I felt it all.  

Curiosity sparked, hearts drew near,  
Laughs through texts, voices sincere,  
From strangers we danced in digital space,  
Learning each secret, each hidden trace.  

No map, no plan, just fate's sweet art,  
Two wandering souls, a start to start,  
Every word, every line, built the thread,  
Leading us closer with each thing said.  

## 2. From Hello to Heartbeat
Conversations deepened, night after night,  
Friendship blossomed, warm and bright,  
Secrets shared in a virtual room,  
A bond growing, dispelling gloom.  

You laughed, I smiled, across the miles,  
Moments stretching, endless trials,  
From simple talks to inside jokes,  
Our hearts spoke louder than mere pokes.  

What began as strangers, shy and new,  
Turned into a world I shared with you,  
From fleeting chats to comfort and cheer,  
Every day you became more dear.  

## 3. The Close One
From strangers, friends, now something more,  
A heart I cherish, adore, explore,  
The late-night talks, the little fights,  
The way we held each other through digital nights.  

Every "good morning" brought a glow,  
Every "good night" made time slow,  
From casual words to tender care,  
A closeness only we could share.  

Though screens kept us physically apart,  
You live, forever, inside my heart,  
What started unknown, now feels like home,  
With you, I'm never truly alone.  

## 4. Realization
It wasn't a moment, but a gentle flow,  
Day by day, you helped me know,  
That love's not loud, it's soft and true,  
And all my roads lead back to you.  

Your kindness spoke louder than any word,  
In your silence, my soul was heard,  
I found in you a calming sea,  
The home I never thought would be.  

Not chance, not luck, but destiny's thread,  
That tied my heart to all you said,  
And in that glow, my heart confessed,  
With you, my soul feels most blessed.  

## 5. The One
Your laughter lit a thousand skies,  
Your care was truth, no sweet disguise,  
I saw the woman, strong and bright,  
My queen, my star, my guiding light.  

Not beauty alone, but soul so kind,  
Respect grew deep within my mind,  
For every word, for every deed,  
You became the answer to my need.  

No more searching, no more roam,  
With you, my heart had found its home,  
The one I choose, the one I see,  
Forevermore, it's you for me.  

## 6. Admiration
I admired the way you love so pure,  
With patience, grace, a heart secure,  
How you lift me when I fall apart,  
And stitch the cracks within my heart.  

Your strength is quiet, your soul refined,  
A rarest gem, one hard to find,  
With every step, you teach me more,  
Of life, of love, of what's in store.  

Not just a lover, but friend and guide,  
With you I need no mask to hide,  
In every way, in all you do,  
My greatest pride is loving you.  

## 7. Respect
I learned respect in the way you care,  
Gentle honesty, always fair,  
Your voice a balm, your words so wise,  
Your truth reflected in your eyes.  

You never ask, yet give so much,  
A healing soul, a tender touch,  
Through miles apart, your strength I feel,  
A love unwavering, raw, and real.  

And so I bow to the love you show,  
My admiration continues to grow,  
For in your heart I see what's true,  
A queen, a guide, my dream, it's you.  

## 8. When Love Spoke
It started with smiles, then nights grew long,  
A whisper of love inside felt strong,  
No longer just friendship, but something new,  
A flame was born, I love you.  

Each word from you a sacred song,  
Each silence sweet, where hearts belong,  
I didn't plan, I didn't see,  
But love had quietly chosen me.  

No doubt remained, no fear, no wall,  
I knew with you I'd risk it all,  
For what's more pure, what's more true,  
Than a forever built with you?  

## 9. Fire Across Miles
Though oceans stand and miles divide,  
Your love still burns deep inside,  
Screens can't dim the flame we share,  
A fire alive, beyond compare.  

Your voice, a touch I've never known,  
Yet in my soul it feels like home,  
My pulse runs wild at every call,  
I crave your presence most of all.  

No map, no flight could ever explain,  
How love survives through joy and pain,  
For distance bows, it bends, it yields,  
To the bond our burning love shields.  

## 10. My Forever
I see my future in your eyes,  
No fleeting dream, no sweet disguise,  
The path is clear, the vow is near,  
With you, my love, there's nothing to fear.  

Each day apart still builds our flame,  
Each moment whispers your sacred name,  
Patience blooms where longing stays,  
Yet love grows stronger through the days.  

Forever isn't just a word,  
It's every promise, felt and heard,  
And in my heart, one truth I keep,  
My love for you runs vast and deep.  

## 11. The Deepest Truth
You are my comfort, my sweetest sin,  
The safest place I've ever been,  
Each thought of you ignites my soul,  
With you, my love, I feel whole.  

Not just desire, but something more,  
Respect, devotion, at the core,  
Through playful laughs, through tender care,  
I find your spirit everywhere.  

And so this truth I can't undo,  
Each beat, each breath belongs to you,  
No distance wide, no storm above,  
Can shake the roots of this true love.  

## 12. I'd Be the Devil
If the world forbid, I'd break its law,  
For you, my queen, I'd bare it raw,  
An angel for most, but for you alone,  
I'd wear the devil, heart overthrown.  

I'd sin in love, I'd burn in flame,  
Just to whisper your sacred name,  
No heaven needed, no saintly grace,  
Just your smile, your touch, your face.  

If shadows rose, I'd never part,  
I'd guard your soul, I'd guard your heart,  
For if I must fall, I'd gladly be,  
The devil in love, eternally.  

## 13. You Taught Me Love
I thought I knew what love could be,  
But you unlocked the truth for me,  
Not fleeting sparks, not empty lies,  
But endless joy in your sweet eyes.  

You showed me love is patient, kind,  
It holds the heart, it calms the mind,  
It laughs, it cries, it fights, it stays,  
It brightens nights and crowns the days.  

With you, I learned what hearts are for,  
Not walls, but doors that open more,  
A gift so rare, so pure, so true,  
Love found its meaning, when I found you.  

## 14. My Happiness
Happiness wears your gentle face,  
A calm, a warmth, a sweet embrace,  
Even from miles, you light my skies,  
My joy is written in your eyes.  

No riches compare, no crown, no gold,  
To the love we share, the truth we hold,  
For in your presence, even apart,  
I find a song within my heart.  

Each laugh you give, each word you send,  
Turns ordinary days to magic again,  
For all my life, I swear it's true,  
My happiest place will be with you.  

## 15. Pages and Promises
I'll bring you the books your heart desires,  
Stories to match our deepest fires,  
We'll read beneath the soft night glow,  
Sharing worlds only we will know.  

Each page a journey, hand in hand,  
Building dreams, as we had planned,  
Your laughter rising between each line,  
A melody forever mine.  

No story ends, no chapter done,  
With you my life has just begun,  
Together we'll write, day by day,  
A love that never fades away.  

## 16. Caring for You
I'll hold your hand when days feel long,  
I'll be your shield when things go wrong,  
In every storm, in every test,  
You'll find your shelter in my chest.  

I'll bring you tea when nights are cold,  
Be your warmth as we grow old,  
From morning light to evening skies,  
I'll keep the sparkle in your eyes.  

For love is care, in little things,  
The joy, the calm that living brings,  
And I will prove my vow is true,  
Forever, I'll be caring for you.  

## 17. Across the World, Forever
We'll wander streets in lands unknown,  
Collecting skies to call our own,  
From ocean waves to mountain air,  
Each step, each scene, with you I'll share.  

Passports stamped with love's embrace,  
Memories stitched in every place,  
A thousand journeys, yet all will show,  
The greatest trip is to love you so.  

And when the maps are fully worn,  
New dreams, new homes, will still be born,  
For the world is ours, but my truth will stay,  
With you, forever, come what may.  

## 18. When We Fought
There were nights we screamed instead of spoke,  
Words like daggers, sharp when they broke,  
Love felt fragile, hanging thin,  
As if the end would soon begin.  

I hated the silence, the walls we built,  
The heavy air, the sting of guilt,  
You turned away, I turned to pride,  
But deep inside, I only cried.  

We said things neither truly meant,  
Let anger take the love we spent,  
And in those storms, I feared the day,  
Our hearts would choose to walk away.  

Yet even then, through pain and fire,  
You were the one my soul desired,  
And though the fights could tear and scar,  
I knew, my love, who you are.  

## 19. My Realization, My Apology, My Promise
I thought of life without your voice,  
A hollow world, an empty choice,  
And in that silence, I came to see,  
Without your love, there's no real me.  

I'm sorry for the times I strayed,  
For every harsh word I carelessly laid,  
For the moments I thought to walk away,  
When all I needed was to stay.  

Your love is not a fleeting flame,  
It's carved in stone, it bears my name,  
No matter the storms, the distance, the years,  
I'll fight for you through doubts and tears.  

I promise, love, my heart is yours,  
Through every trial, through all closed doors,  
No fight, no fear can change this truth,  
You are my forever, my sweetest proof.  

So take my hand, forgive the past,  
Let's build a love that will always last,  
For my soul belongs to only you.  

## 20. My Promise to You
I promise steadiness when storms collide,  
A steady hand, your faithful guide,  
To meet you gently where you stand,  
And build our world with careful hands.  

I promise laughter on ordinary days,  
Warmth in winters, sunlight's rays,  
To learn your hurts and soothe your fears,  
To hold your heart through all our years.  

I promise truth when shadows play,  
To choose your side, come what may,  
Small daily vows, a thousand ways,  
To love you deeper with each phase.  

I promise patience, space, and grace,  
To keep your smile upon my face,  
No turning back, no silent doubt,  
My life, my love, my all, throughout.  

## 21. Continuum
This is not an ending, nor a final page,  
But a ribbon unrolling beyond the stage,  
A vow that stretches past sunrise and dust,  
An echo of us bound in endless trust.  

If stars burn out and galaxies slow,  
If time's last heartbeat ever ceases to flow,  
Still will our promise quietly remain,  
A pulse of love in the great domain.  

We are a story that space cannot sever,  
A thread that hums across forever,  
Not bound to ink, nor clock, nor fate,  
But living where forever and always wait.  

So hold my hand as worlds expand,  
As seasons pass and new dreams land,  
This love, our continuum, will ever be,  
Past this universe, it carries you and me.
